  abstract      = {We show how the categorical logic of untyped, simply typed
                   and dependently typed lambda calculus can be structured
                   around the notion of category with family (cwf). To this end
                   we introduce subcategories of simply typed cwfs (scwfs),
                   where types do not depend on variables, and unityped cwfs
                   (ucwfs), where there is only one type. We prove several
                   equivalence and biequivalence theorems between cwf-based
                   notions and basic notions of categorical logic, such as
                   cartesian operads, Lawvere theories, categories with finite
                   products and limits, cartesian closed categories, and
                   locally cartesian closed categories. Some of these theorems
                   depend on the restrictions of contextuality (in the sense of
                   Cartmell) or democracy (used by Clairambault and Dybjer for
                   their biequivalence theorems). Some theorems are
                   equivalences between notions with strict preservation of
                   chosen structure. Others are biequivalences between notions
                   where properties are only preserved up to isomorphism. In
                   addition to this we discuss various constructions of initial
                   ucwfs, scwfs, and cwfs with extra structure.},
