  Inductive families provide a convenient way of programming with dependent
  types. Yet, when it comes to compilation, their default linked-tree runtime
  representations, as well as the need to convert between different indexed
  views of the same data when programming with dependent types, can lead to
  unsatisfactory runtime performance. In this paper, we aim to introduce a
  language with dependent types, and inductive families with custom
  representations. Representations are a version of Wadler's views
  \cite{Wadler1987-zp}, refined to inductive families like in Epigram
  \cite{Mcbride2004-fd}. However, representations come with compilation
  guarantees: a represented inductive family will not leave any runtime traces
  behind, without having to rely on automated optimisations such as
  deforestation \cite{Wadler1990-yo}. This way, we can build a library of
  convenient inductive families based on a minimal set of primitives, whose
  re-indexing and conversion functions are erased at compile-time. In addition,
  we show how we can express inductive data optimisation techniques, such as
  representing \datalab{Nat}-like types as GMP-style big integers, without
  special casing in the compiler. With dependent types, reasoning about data
  representations is possible; for example, we get computationally irrelevant
  isomorphisms between the original and represented data.
