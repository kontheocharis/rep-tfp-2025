  Inductive families enable a convenient way of programming with dependent
  types, where dependent pattern matching automatically handles a lot of the
  otherwise manual work of reasoning about index refinement. However, when it
  comes to compilation, the default representation of inductive types can be
  inefficient. Often, we want multiple indexed views of the same data, which has
  runtime overhead with current methods. In this paper, introduce a language
  with dependent types, and inductive families with custom representations. A
  type family $F$ can be used to represent the inductive family $D$ as long as $T$
  can mimic $D$'s constructors and induction principle. This way, we can build
  up a standard library of convenient inductive families, whose re-indexing
  conversion functions are erased at compile-time. In particular, we show how we
  can reproduce and extend the `Nat-hack' from Agda, Idris and Lean, fully
  within the language. Since we are working with dependent types, we can indeed
  reason about data representations internally; in this spirit, we are awarded
  with a correctness proof of the Nat-hack, for free.
