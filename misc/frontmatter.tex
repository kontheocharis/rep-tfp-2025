  %   This is a short example to demonstrate the \LaTeX\ style files used to prepare
  %   submissions for \conf, and for preparing the final version of papers
  %   accepted for the conference.
  %   These Proceedings will appear in the \emph{Electronic Notes in Theoretical Informatics and
  %   Computer Science} (ENTICS), a new series that is published under the
  %   auspices of Epsiciences.org, the French national organization that supports open
  %   access overlay publications in a broad range of scientific disciplines.
