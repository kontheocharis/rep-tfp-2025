\section{Implementation}\label{sec:implementation}

\superfluid is a programming language with dependent types with quantities,
inductive families and data representations. Its compiler is written in Haskell
and the compilation target is JavaScript. After prior to code generation, the
$\R$ transformation is applied to the elaborated core program, which erases all
inductive constructs with defined representations. Then, a JavaScript program is
extracted, erasing all irrelevant data by usage analysis similarly to Idris 2.
As a result, with appropriate postulates in the prelude, we are able to
represent $\datalab{Nat}$ as JavaScript's \texttt{BigInt}, and
$\datalab{List}\ T$/$\datalab{SnocList}\ T$/$\datalab{Vec}\ T\ n$ as
JavaScript's arrays with the appropriate index refinement, such that we can
convert between them without any runtime overhead. We have formulated many of
the examples in this paper in \superfluid, which can be found in the
\texttt{examples} directory.

The syntax of Superfluid very closely mirrors the syntax given in the first half
of this paper. We are working on adding dependent pattern matching to
\superfluid that is elaborated to internal eliminators, so that we can take
advantage of the structural unification rules for data types
\cite{McBride2006-fp} to reduce proof overhead.
