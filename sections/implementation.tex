\superfluid is a programming language with dependent $\Pi$ types, inductive
families and dependent pattern matching. Its compiler is written in Haskell and
the compilation target is JavaScript. Dependent pattern matching in \superfluid
is elaborated to a core language with internal eliminators. The $\R$
transformation is then applied to the core program, which erases all inductive
types with defined representations. This is translated to JavaScript, where the
core language has defined primitives that mirror JavaScript's core types and
operations.

As a result, we are able to represent $\datalab{Nat}$ as JavaScript's
$\primlab{BigInt}$, and $\datalab{List}\ T$, $\datalab{SnocList}\
T$,$\datalab{Vec}\ T\ n$ as JavaScript's arrays with the appropriate index
refinement, an inductively defined  $\datalab{String}$
