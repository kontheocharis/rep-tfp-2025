\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

Inductive families are a generalisation of inductive data types found in some
programming languages with dependent types. Every inductive definition is
equipped with an eliminator that captures the notion of mathematical induction
over the data, and in particular, enables structural recursion over the data.
This is a powerful tool for programming as well as theorem proving. However,
this abstraction has a cost when it comes to compilation: the runtime
representation of inductive types is a linked tree structure. This
representation is not always the most efficient for all operations, and often
forces users to rely on more efficient machine primitives to achieve desirable
performance, at the cost of structural recursion and dependent pattern matching.
This is the first problem we aim to address in this paper.

Despite advances in the erasure of irrelevant indices in inductive families
\cite{Brady2004-ay} and the use of theories with irrelevant fragments
\cite{Atkey2018-pj,Moon2021-eb}, there is still a need to convert
between different indexed views of the same data. For example, the function to
convert from $\datalab{BinTree}\ T$ to $\datalab{BinTreeOfHeight}\ T\ n$ by forgetting the
height index $n$ is \emph{not} erased by any current language with dependent
types, unless sized binary trees are defined as a refinement of binary trees
with an erased height field (which hinders dependent pattern matching due to the
presence of non-structural witnesses), or a Church encoding is used in a
Curry-style context \cite{Diehl2018-ba} (which restricts the flexibility of data
representation). This is the second problem we aim to address in this paper.

Wadler's views \cite{Wadler1987-zp} provide a way to abstract over inductive
interfaces, so that different views of the same data can be defined and
converted between seamlessly. In the context of inductive families, views have
been used in Epigram \cite{Mcbride2004-fd} that utilise the index refinement
machinery of dependent pattern matching to avoid certain proof obligations with
eliminator-like constructs. While views exhibit a nice way to transport across a
bijection between the original data and the viewed data, they do not utilise
this bijection to erase the view from the program.

In this paper, we propose an extension $\lambdadata$ to Martin-L\"of type theory with
which allows programmers to define inductive types with custom,
correct-by-construction data representations. This is done through user-defined
translations of the constructors and eliminators of an inductive type to a
concrete implementation, which form a bijective view of the original data called
a `representation'. Representations are defined internally to the language, and
require coherence properties that ensure a representation is faithful to its the
original inductive family. We contribute the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A formulation of common optimisations such as the `Nat-hack', and
        similarly for other inductive types, as well as zero-cost data reuse when
        reindexing, using representations (\cref{sec:examples}).
        \item A dependent type system $\lambdadata$ with data types formulated
        as inductive algebras for signatures, along with a translation to
        $\lambdamltt$ that replaces all data types with their defined inductive
        algebras (\cref{sec:type-system}). We have formalised this in Agda.
        \item A prototype implementation of this system in \textsc{Superfluid},
        a programming language with inductive types and dependent pattern
        matching (\cref{sec:implementation}).
\end{itemize}
